### Welcome to the Alumni Repository.

>The goal of this repo is to give you some tips and a solid head-start to finding your first job as a developer. It's still a **work in progess** - so keep checking back every now and then.

You've already learned a lot of skills now - but ask yourself: Is that visible in my portfolio and CV? 
Presenting yourself well and being prepared for job interviews is almost just as important as the actual skills when it comes to landing the job, so let's make sure that you present yourself just as good as you actually are!

There are many online resources that can help you get ready for a job, and we want to share some of the best of them with you. We organised this as a wiki this time, because it will be mostly text-based.

For some actual technical assignment from Danish companies check this repo: [company-technical-tests](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/company-technical-tests)
