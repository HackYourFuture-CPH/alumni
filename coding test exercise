Summary

Take a look at: http://ranker.owlin.com

Here we want to integrate support for pinboards.

We want to do this using a central API where multiple dashboards can 'pin' articles to one of their pinboards.

Therefor we need an API, that works like this:


http put /pinboards/[somepinboard-id]/[some-article-id]

 
{

  "user":"Name of user that pinned the article"

  "epoch":3983948    

}

 
It also needs to remember when the article was pinned.

 

Deliverables 

1. Working HTTP JSON REST API

  - POST /pinboards                  

  creates a new pinboard, and returns at least the id

  - DELETE /pimboards/[somepinboard-id]

  deletes an existing pinboard  

  - PUT /pinboards/[somepinboard-id]/[some-article-id]       

  pins an article to a pinboard

  - DELETE /pinboards/[somepinboard-id]/[some-article-id]

  unpins an article to a pinboard

  - GET /pinboards/[somepinboard-id]

  gets all the pins of one pinboard

 
2. Simple front-end that allows to create and delete pinboards (will only be used internally)

 
Freedom

 

Use any language, any database system, any framework you like.

 
Out of scope:

 

- authorization

- authentication

- scalability of datalayer

- design of front-end
