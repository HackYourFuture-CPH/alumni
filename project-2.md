You should build this frontend project using **React.js**. You are allowed to use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS, and a state mangement tool like Redux, but this is not mandatory.

However, the better you make it, the more youâ€™ll learn, the more you'll impress and get you closer to the job.

### User Stories

**User Story #1**: I should be able to see an outer container with a corresponding `id="sound-machine"` that contains all other elements.

**User Story #2**: Within `#sound-machine` I can see an element with a corresponding `id="display"`.

**User Story #3**: Within `#sound-machine` I can see 9 clickable pad elements, each with a class name of `sound-pad`, a unique id that describes the audio clip the sound pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The sound pads MUST be in this order. Feel free to use any sounds you like!

**User Story #4**: Within each `.sound-pad`, there should be an HTML5 audio element which has a `src` attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of `clip`, and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent `.sound-pad` (e.g. `id="Q"`, `id="W"`, `id="E"` etc.).

**User Story #5**: When I click on a `.sound-pad` element, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered.

**User Story #6**: When I press the trigger key associated with each .sound-pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the Q key should trigger the sound pad which contains the string "Q", pressing the W key should trigger the sound pad which contains the string "W", etc.).

**User Story #7**: When a `.sound-pad` is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the `#display` element (each string must be unique).
